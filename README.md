This is a trial Headless CMS version of Astro and WordPress. 

Use the following video for an idea of how it's done.

Be aware that the Youtube video's github repository hosting the example code is outdated. You will need to run the below command in the folder containing all the files. 

npx @astrojs/upgrade

This is best done with a command line tool like https://gitforwindows.org/.

I have got it running locally but not on Netlify at the moment.
